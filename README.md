# Euler10_Python

Problem 10 of Project Euler solved in Python 3 using PyCharm. A Prime Number generator was borrowed from Stack Overflow User [Robert William Hanks](https://stackoverflow.com/users/350331/robert-william-hanks) (See Links and References). This algorithm was borrowed as a more efficient replacement to the Sieve of Eratosthenes, as this algorithm utilizes python's capability to manipulate list slices instead of individual index modifications.

## Project Euler Problem 10 -- Summation of Primes

The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
